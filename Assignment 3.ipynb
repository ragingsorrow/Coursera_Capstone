Since we are hoping to invest in various types of opportunities, we will be looking at different venues in different neighborhoods. There are several neighborhoods in Toronto area. It will be less efficient to exaxmine each neighborhood for a high-level analysis like this. Therefore, I'm planning to cluster these neighborhoods into clusters based on their venue counts. After determining the optimal number of clusters and successfully clustering neighborhoods, I can check within each cluster to see what are the majority of the venues in each cluster. The result of this observation can give me a high-level understanding of each cluster, namely, I can say if cluster/district 1 is a food district and district 2 is a financial district, etc.\n",
